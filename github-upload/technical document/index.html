            Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that focuses on short, 
            challenging routes or "problems" on small rock formations, 
            known as boulders. Unlike traditional rock climbing, 
            which often involves climbing tall cliffs or walls with ropes and harnesses, 
            bouldering is typically done at lower heights and without the use of safety 
            ropes or harnesses. Instead, boulderers rely on crash pads placed on the 
            ground to cushion their falls.

          <ul>
            <li>Short, Intense Climbs</li>
            <li>Strength and Technique</li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Participants must be wearing appropriate clothing, with empty pockets and with jewellery removed or made safe;

              Well-fitting specialist climbing shoes will help your participants have much better personal control when actually bouldering,

          <p>Given the often intense and

          <div class="answer" id="answer1">All you will need to take part in bouldering is a pair of climbing shoes, which you can hire from the gym.</div>
          <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">Is Bouldering a good exercise?</div>
          <div class="answer" id="answer2">Rock climbing is a fantastic all-round form of exercise and a great, fun alternative to the boredom of Gyms. Climbing doesn’t always require you to have super strong arms, as climbs can be completed using technique and finesse also. As well as being great exercise, climbing will also promote proprioception, problem-solving, and coordination skills!
