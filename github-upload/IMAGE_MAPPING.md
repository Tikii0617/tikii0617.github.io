## Skills Button Fix Documentation

### Issue:
The Skills button in the assistant interface was not responding to clicks.

### Root Cause:
Event delegation was working, but the skills case in `handleQuickAction` function was not properly displaying the message content.

### Solution Implemented:
Created a special interceptor for the skills button that:
1. Detects skills button clicks specifically
2. Bypasses the normal `handleQuickAction` flow
3. Forces message display through multiple fallback methods:
   - Primary: Normal chat area display
   - Secondary: Dynamic chat area creation
   - Tertiary: Direct DOM manipulation
   - Ultimate fallback: Alert dialog

### Code Location:
- File: `assets/js/main.js`
- Function: Event listener for `.quick-btn` elements
- Special handling for `data-action="skills"`

### Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The skills button now has triple-redundancy protection ensuring it will display content regardless of the chat interface state.
